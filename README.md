# One Pitch
In life, you only have 60 seconds to impress someone. 1 minute can make or break you.

One pitch is an application that ensures that you use your one minute wisely and say something meaningful. It allows users to submit one minute pitches and have other users vote and leave comments on them to give feedback.
